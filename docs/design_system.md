# Preprocessor System - System Level Design

## Overview
This document defines the system-level behavioral design for the preprocessor system, detailing the high-level architecture, component interactions, and system-wide behaviors that realize the acceptance criteria. This specification focuses on system behaviors and component responsibilities without implementation specifics.

## System Architecture Principles

### Architectural Patterns
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential processing stages with clear input/output contracts
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible components with standardized interfaces
- **Configuration-Driven Design**: Behavior controlled through external configuration
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between core processing and extension points

### System Qualities
- **Modularity**: Components can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Extensibility**: New functionality added through plugins without core changes
- **Configurability**: System behavior adapted through configuration without code changes
- **Testability**: All behaviors testable through well-defined interfaces

## System Components and Responsibilities

### 1. Preprocessor Engine (Core Orchestrator)
**Primary Responsibility**: Coordinates the entire preprocessing workflow, managing component interactions and ensuring data flow integrity.

**Behavioral Specification**:
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manages execution sequence of splitting, normalization, and plugin operations
- **Data Flow Management**: Ensures proper data handoff between processing stages
- **Error Coordination**: Aggregates errors from components and implements recovery strategies
- **Resource Management**: Optimizes memory usage and processing efficiency across operations

**Input/Output Behavior**:
```
Input: Raw time series data + Complete system configuration
Output: Six processed datasets + Normalization parameters + Processing metadata
Error Conditions: Data validation failures, component initialization errors, resource constraints
```

**Quality Behaviors**:
- Must handle datasets up to 10M samples within memory constraints
- Must provide processing progress indicators for long-running operations
- Must support graceful cancellation of processing operations
- Must generate comprehensive audit logs for all processing decisions

### 2. Dataset Splitter (Temporal Partitioning)
**Primary Responsibility**: Partitions time series data into six temporal datasets while preserving chronological relationships and ensuring split integrity.

**Behavioral Specification**:
- **Temporal Split Execution**: Divides data based on configurable ratios with temporal ordering preservation
- **Split Validation**: Ensures mathematical correctness of ratios and minimum dataset requirements
- **Boundary Management**: Maintains clear temporal boundaries between datasets
- **Metadata Generation**: Produces detailed information about split characteristics and boundaries

**Split Behavior Patterns**:
```
Input Validation:
- Verify minimum dataset size (≥60 samples for valid 6-way split)
- Validate ratio configuration (sum = 1.0 ± 0.001)
- Check temporal column presence and ordering

Split Execution:
- Calculate exact split boundaries using cumulative ratio application
- Apply split boundaries with rounding to nearest integer
- Verify no sample loss or duplication across splits
- Maintain temporal ordering within each dataset

Quality Assurance:
- Generate split metadata including sample counts and temporal ranges
- Validate split integrity through cross-checks
- Provide detailed logging of split decisions and boundary calculations
```

**Error Behaviors**:
- Invalid ratios: Reject configuration with specific guidance on corrections
- Insufficient data: Provide minimum requirements and alternative suggestions
- Temporal discontinuities: Flag and handle gaps in time series data appropriately

### 3. Normalization Manager (Statistical Transformation)
**Primary Responsibility**: Computes and applies z-score normalization consistently across datasets using parameters derived exclusively from training data.

**Behavioral Specification**:
- **Parameter Computation**: Calculates feature-wise statistics from designated training datasets only
- **Parameter Persistence**: Manages storage and retrieval of normalization parameters in JSON format
- **Consistent Application**: Applies identical parameters across all datasets to prevent data leakage
- **Reversibility Support**: Enables accurate denormalization for result interpretation

**Normalization Behavior Patterns**:
```
Training Parameter Computation:
- Combine designated training datasets (typically d1, d2)
- Calculate per-feature means and standard deviations
- Validate statistical assumptions (finite values, non-zero variance)
- Handle missing values through appropriate statistical methods

Parameter Storage Management:
- Save means to means.json with feature-wise organization
- Save standard deviations to stds.json with matching structure
- Include metadata: computation timestamp, feature list, dataset sources
- Implement atomic writes to prevent corrupted parameter files

Cross-Dataset Application:
- Apply identical parameters to all six datasets
- Use formula: normalized_value = (original_value - mean) / std
- Handle edge cases: zero variance features, missing features, infinite values
- Maintain feature alignment across datasets

Quality Control:
- Verify normalization results: training data should have mean≈0, std≈1
- Check denormalization accuracy within specified tolerance
- Log normalization statistics and quality metrics
```

**Statistical Behaviors**:
- Must handle features with different scales and distributions appropriately
- Must detect and handle constant-value features (zero variance)
- Must provide warnings for features with high skewness or outliers
- Must support feature subset normalization when not all features are numeric

### 4. Plugin Orchestrator (Extension Management)
**Primary Responsibility**: Manages the lifecycle and execution of external feature engineering and postprocessing plugins, ensuring proper data flow and error isolation.

**Behavioral Specification**:
- **Plugin Discovery**: Automatically identifies available plugins from configured locations
- **Interface Validation**: Verifies plugin compliance with standardized interfaces
- **Execution Pipeline**: Manages sequential plugin execution with proper data chaining
- **Failure Isolation**: Contains plugin errors to prevent system-wide failures

**Plugin Management Behavior Patterns**:
```
Plugin Discovery and Loading:
- Scan configured plugin directories for valid plugin files
- Load plugin metadata and interface definitions
- Validate plugin interfaces against standard specifications
- Register successfully validated plugins for execution

Feature Engineering Pipeline:
- Execute plugins in configured sequence order
- Chain outputs: Plugin_N+1_input = Plugin_N_output
- Validate data integrity at each pipeline stage
- Track feature provenance and transformation history

Postprocessing Pipeline:
- Execute after core preprocessing completion
- Apply conditional logic based on data characteristics
- Maintain data schema consistency throughout pipeline
- Generate transformation audit trails

Error Handling and Recovery:
- Isolate plugin failures to prevent cascade effects
- Log detailed error information with plugin identification
- Implement fallback strategies for failed plugins
- Provide plugin health monitoring and diagnostics
```

**Plugin Interface Behaviors**:
- Must enforce standardized plugin interfaces for consistency
- Must provide plugin configuration inheritance from global settings
- Must support plugin-specific parameter validation and type checking
- Must enable plugin hot-reloading for development environments

### 5. Configuration Manager (System Configuration)
**Primary Responsibility**: Manages hierarchical configuration loading, validation, and resolution across multiple configuration sources.

**Behavioral Specification**:
- **Hierarchical Loading**: Resolves configuration from multiple sources with proper precedence
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures configuration compliance with formal schemas
- **Parameter Resolution**: Resolves final parameter values through inheritance hierarchy
- **Migration Support**: Handles legacy configuration format upgrades

**Configuration Behavior Patterns**:
```
Configuration Source Hierarchy (highest to lowest precedence):
1. Command-line parameters (highest precedence)
2. Environment variables
3. Plugin-specific configuration sections
4. Environment configuration files
5. Global default configuration (lowest precedence)

Loading and Resolution Process:
- Load configuration from all available sources
- Apply precedence rules to resolve parameter conflicts
- Validate merged configuration against schema definitions
- Generate final resolved configuration with provenance tracking

Validation Behaviors:
- Schema compliance: Check required fields, data types, value ranges
