# Preprocessor System - Acceptance Level Design

## Overview
This document defines the acceptance-level behavioral design for the preprocessor system refactoring. Following behavior-driven development (BDD) principles, this specification focuses on business requirements and user acceptance criteria, independent of implementation details.

## Business Context
The preprocessor system is a modular data transformation pipeline that processes time series data for machine learning applications. It must efficiently transform raw financial time series data into multiple standardized datasets while supporting extensible plugin architectures for feature engineering and postprocessing operations.

## Stakeholders
- **Data Scientists**: Require consistent, high-quality preprocessed datasets
- **ML Engineers**: Need reliable data pipelines with predictable performance
- **System Administrators**: Require maintainable, 
configurable systems
- **Plugin Developers**: Need clear interfaces for extending functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Six-Dataset Temporal Splitting
**Business Need**: Data scientists require temporal data splits that preserve chronological relationships while providing multiple training/validation/test combinations.

**Behavioral Specification**:
```gherkin
Feature: Six-Dataset Temporal Splitting
  As a data scientist
  I want to split time series data into six temporal datasets (d1-d6)
  So that I can train models with proper temporal validation

  Scenario: Standard temporal split with configurable ratios
    Given raw time series data with 10,000 chronologically ordered samples
    And split configuration with ratios d1:0.4, d2:0.2, d3:0.2, d4:0.1, d5:0.05, d6:0.05
    When the preprocessor executes the splitting operation
    Then exactly six datasets are generated (d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6)
    And dataset d1 contains 4,000 samples (±1 for rounding)
    And dataset d2 contains 2,000 samples (±1 for rounding)
    And dataset d3 contains 2,000 samples (±1 for rounding)
    And dataset d4 contains 1,000 samples (±1 for rounding)
    And dataset d5 contains 500 samples (±1 for rounding)
    And dataset d6 contains 500 samples (±1 for rounding)
    And each dataset maintains chronological ordering internally
    And no temporal overlap exists between consecutive datasets
    And the union of all datasets equals the original dataset

  Scenario: Minimum dataset size validation
    Given raw time series data with insufficient samples for valid splitting
    When the preprocessor attempts to split the data
    Then the system rejects the operation
    And provides clear error message indicating minimum requirements
    And suggests alternative split configurations

  Scenario: Custom split ratio validation
    Given split ratios that do not sum to 1.0 (within tolerance of 0.001)
    When the preprocessor validates the configuration
    Then the system rejects the invalid configuration
    And provides specific guidance on ratio requirements
    And suggests corrected ratio values
```

**Quality Attributes**:
- **Accuracy**: Split ratios must be accurate within ±0.1% of specified values
- **Performance**: Splitting 1M samples must complete within 10 seconds
- **Reliability**: Temporal ordering must be preserved with 100% accuracy

### AC2: Dual Z-Score Normalization with Parameter Persistence
**Business Need**: Consistent normalization across multiple datasets using parameters computed from training data only, with ability to apply same normalization to new data.

**Behavioral Specification**:
```gherkin
Feature: Dual Z-Score Normalization with Parameter Persistence
  As a data scientist
  I want z-score normalization computed from training datasets only
  So that I can apply consistent normalization to all datasets without data leakage

  Scenario: Parameter computation from training datasets
    Given six split datasets (d1-d6) with numeric features
    And configuration specifying d1 and d2 as training datasets
    When normalization parameters are computed
    Then means are calculated using only d1 and d2 data
    And standard deviations are calculated using only d1 and d2 data
    And parameters exclude any data from d3, d4, d5, or d6
    And parameters are saved to separate JSON files (means.json, stds.json)

  Scenario: Consistent normalization across all datasets
    Given computed normalization parameters from training data
    When normalization is applied to all six datasets
    Then all datasets use identical mean and standard deviation values
    And normalized data follows formula: (value - mean) / std
    And normalized training data has mean ≈ 0.0 (±0.01) and std ≈ 1.0 (±0.01)
    And normalized validation/test data maintains statistical relationships

  Scenario: Parameter persistence and reusability
    Given normalization parameters stored in JSON files
    When a new dataset requires normalization
    Then parameters can be loaded from JSON files
    And applied to new data without recomputation
    And denormalization can recover original values within 0.001% accuracy

  Scenario: Feature-wise parameter handling
    Given multi-feature time series data
    When normalization is applied
    Then each feature has independent mean and standard deviation
    And missing features in new data are detected and reported
    And extra features in new data are handled gracefully
```

**Quality Attributes**:
- **Precision**: Normalization accuracy within 1e-6 tolerance
- **Consistency**: Identical results across multiple runs with same data
- **Reversibility**: Denormalization must recover original values within 0.001% error

### AC3: External Feature Engineering Plugin Integration
**Business Need**: Extensible system allowing data scientists to integrate custom feature engineering logic without modifying core system.

**Behavioral Specification**:
```gherkin
Feature: External Feature Engineering Plugin Integration
  As a plugin developer
  I want to create feature engineering plugins that integrate seamlessly
  So that I can extend preprocessing capabilities without core system changes

  Scenario: Plugin discovery and loading
    Given feature engineering plugins in configured directories
    When the preprocessor system initializes
    Then all valid plugins are discovered automatically
    And plugin interfaces are validated for compliance
    And plugin loading errors are reported with specific guidance
    And successfully loaded plugins are available for pipeline execution

  Scenario: Plugin pipeline execution with data chaining
    Given loaded feature engineering plugins [MovingAverage, TechnicalIndicators, CustomFeatures]
    And input dataset with base features [OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME]
    When the feature engineering pipeline executes
    Then MovingAverage plugin processes base features first
    And TechnicalIndicators plugin receives MovingAverage output as input
    And CustomFeatures plugin receives TechnicalIndicators output as input
    And final dataset contains base features plus all plugin-generated features
    And feature provenance is tracked throughout the pipeline

  Scenario: Plugin failure isolation and recovery
    Given feature engineering pipeline with one failing plugin
    When plugin execution encounters an error
    Then the failing plugin is isolated and skipped
    And pipeline continues with remaining plugins
    And error details are logged with plugin identification
    And final dataset excludes failed plugin features but includes others
    And system remains stable and processable

  Scenario: Plugin configuration and parameterization
    Given plugins with configurable parameters
    When plugins are executed with specific configurations
    Then each plugin receives its designated parameter set
    And global parameters are inherited where appropriate
    And plugin-specific parameters override global values
    And parameter validation occurs before plugin execution
```

**Quality Attributes**:
- **Isolation**: Plugin failures must not crash the core system
- **Performance**: Plugin overhead must not exceed 20% of base processing time
- **Flexibility**: Support for any plugin implementing standard interface

### AC4: External Postprocessing Plugin Support
**Business Need**: Ability to apply final transformations after core preprocessing, supporting conditional logic based on data characteristics.

**Behavioral Specification**:
```gherkin
Feature: External Postprocessing Plugin Support
  As a data scientist
  I want postprocessing plugins that execute after normalization
  So that I can apply final transformations without affecting core preprocessing

  Scenario: Postprocessing pipeline execution order
    Given preprocessed and normalized datasets
    And configured postprocessing plugins [OutlierDetection, DataSmoothing, QualityAssurance]
    When postprocessing pipeline executes
    Then plugins execute after all core preprocessing is complete
    And plugins execute in configured order
    And each plugin receives the output of the previous plugin
    And final datasets reflect all postprocessing transformations

  Scenario: Conditional postprocessing based on data characteristics
    Given postprocessing plugins with conditional execution rules
    And datasets with varying characteristics
    When postprocessing evaluates execution conditions
    Then OutlierDetection executes only if outliers are detected (>3 sigma)
    And DataSmoothing executes only if noise level exceeds threshold
    And QualityAssurance executes unconditionally
    And conditional logic is evaluated per dataset independently

  Scenario: Data integrity preservation throughout postprocessing
    Given datasets passing through postprocessing pipeline
    When each postprocessing step executes
    Then data schema consistency is maintained
    And temporal ordering is preserved where applicable
    And data volume changes are tracked and reported
    And quality metrics are computed at each stage
```

**Quality Attributes**:
- **Integrity**: Data corruption rate must be 0%
- **Traceability**: All transformations must be logged and reversible
- **Configurability**: Conditional logic must be externally configurable

### AC5: Modern Hierarchical Configuration Architecture
**Business Need**: Flexible configuration system supporting multiple sources, inheritance, and validation to accommodate diverse deployment scenarios.

**Behavioral Specification**:
```gherkin
Feature: Modern Hierarchical Configuration Architecture
  As a system administrator
  I want hierarchical configuration management with validation
  So that I can deploy the system across different environments with appropriate customization

  Scenario: Configuration hierarchy and inheritance
    Given global default configuration
    And environment-specific configuration file
    And command-line parameter overrides
    And plugin-specific configuration sections
    When configuration is loaded and resolved
    Then plugin parameters override environment parameters
    And environment parameters override global defaults
    And command-line parameters override all other sources
    And final configuration reflects proper precedence hierarchy

  Scenario: Comprehensive configuration validation
    Given configuration from multiple sources
    When configuration validation executes
    Then schema compliance is verified against formal definitions
    And parameter ranges and constraints are validated
    And cross-parameter dependencies are checked
    And plugin-specific requirements are validated
    And detailed error reports identify specific validation failures

  Scenario: Configuration migration and backward compatibility
    Given legacy configuration files from previous system versions
    When configuration migration is executed
    Then legacy formats are detected automatically
    And configurations are upgraded to current schema
    And deprecated parameters are mapped to new equivalents
    And migration warnings identify manual attention requirements
    And original configuration files are preserved as backups
```

**Quality Attributes**:
- **Validation**: 95% of configuration errors caught before runtime
- **Flexibility**: Support for 5+ configuration sources with clear precedence
- **Usability**: Clear error messages with specific remediation guidance

### AC6: Backward Compatibility and Migration Support
**Business Need**: Seamless transition from existing preprocessor implementations without disrupting established workflows.

**Behavioral Specification**:
```gherkin
Feature: Backward Compatibility and Migration Support
  As an existing system user
  I want the refactored preprocessor to work with my existing configurations
  So that I can upgrade without disrupting established workflows

  Scenario: Legacy workflow preservation
    Given existing preprocessor configurations and data files
    When the refactored system processes legacy inputs
    Then all existing workflows execute successfully
    And output formats remain compatible with downstream systems
    And processing results are functionally equivalent to legacy system
    And performance characteristics are maintained or improved

  Scenario: API contract preservation
    Given existing integration points with the preprocessor
    When external systems interact with the refactored preprocessor
    Then all existing API endpoints remain functional
    And response formats maintain backward compatibility
    And error handling behavior is consistent with legacy expectations
    And integration documentation accurately reflects any changes

  Scenario: Data format compatibility
    Given legacy data files and output formats
    When the refactored system processes legacy data
    Then input data formats are correctly interpreted
    And output data maintains expected structure and content
    And metadata and auxiliary files remain accessible
    And data migration tools handle format evolution gracefully
```

**Quality Attributes**:
- **Compatibility**: 100% of existing workflows must function without modification
