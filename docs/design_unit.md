# Preprocessor System - Unit Level Design

## Overview
This document defines the unit-level behavioral design for the preprocessor system, specifying the detailed behaviors of individual classes, methods, and functions. This specification focuses on unit behaviors and responsibilities without implementation constraints, enabling behavior-driven development at the finest granularity.

## Unit Design Principles

### Behavioral Specification Approach
- **Single Responsibility**: Each unit has one clearly defined behavioral responsibility
- **Interface Contracts**: All units defined through input/output behavioral contracts
- **Error Behavior**: Comprehensive specification of error conditions and responses
- **State Behavior**: Clear specification of state transitions and invariants

### Testing Strategy Alignment
- **Behavior-Driven**: Units specified through behavioral scenarios
- **Implementation Independent**: Specifications remain valid across implementation changes
- **Mockable Dependencies**: All dependencies specified through behavioral interfaces
- **Property-Based**: Units support property-based testing for comprehensive coverage

## Core Unit Specifications

### U1: PreprocessorEngine Class

**Primary Behavioral Responsibility**: Orchestrate the complete preprocessing workflow while maintaining data integrity and providing comprehensive error handling.

#### U1.1: PreprocessorEngine.initialize(configuration) Behavior

**Behavioral Contract**:
```
Given: System configuration containing all component specifications
When: initialize() is called
Then: All components are instantiated with proper configuration
And: Component compatibility is verified
And: System is ready for data processing
And: Initialization status is available for inspection
```

**Input Behavior Specification**:
```
Valid Configuration Input:
- Must contain split ratios that sum to 1.0 ± 0.001
- Must specify training datasets for normalization (typically ['d1', 'd2'])
- Must include valid plugin specifications (paths and configurations)
- Must specify valid output configurations

Invalid Configuration Handling:
- Empty configuration: Use system defaults, emit warning
- Malformed configuration: Raise ConfigurationError with specific remediation
- Incomplete configuration: Fill gaps with defaults, log substitutions
```

**Component Initialization Behavior**:
```
Initialization Sequence:
1. Validate configuration completeness and correctness
2. Initialize Dataset Splitter with split configuration
3. Initialize Normalization Manager with normalization configuration
4. Initialize Plugin Orchestrator with plugin specifications
5. Initialize Data Handler with I/O configuration
6. Verify cross-component compatibility
7. Set system state to 'ready' or 'error' based on initialization outcome

Error Recovery Behavior:
- Component initialization failure: Log specific error, attempt graceful degradation
- Configuration conflict: Report conflicts with resolution suggestions
- Resource unavailability: Provide resource requirement information
```

#### U1.2: PreprocessorEngine.execute_preprocessing(input_data) Behavior

```

**Pipeline Execution Behavior**:
```

2. Execute dataset splitting through Dataset Splitter
3. Compute normalization parameters from training datasets
4. Apply normalization to all six datasets
5. Execute feature engineering plugin pipeline
6. Execute postprocessing plugin pipeline
7. Generate final output with comprehensive metadata

Progress Reporting Behavior:
- Emit progress updates at 10% completion intervals
- Report current operation and estimated remaining time

```

**Error Handling Behavior**:
```
Recoverable Errors:

- Ratios must be specified for exactly six datasets (d1-d6)

Practical Validation:
- Minimum ratio per dataset: 0.01 (1% of data minimum)
- Recommended minimum samples per dataset: 10
- Warning for highly imbalanced splits (any ratio > 0.8)
```

**Error Reporting Behavior**:
```
Detailed Error Messages:
- "Split ratios sum to {actual_sum}, must equal 1.0 ± 0.001"
- "Ratio for dataset {dataset_name} is {ratio}, must be > 0"

## Unit Behavior Quality Specifications

### Error Behavior Specifications
Every unit must implement comprehensive error behavior:

```
Error Categories:
1. Input Validation Errors: Invalid parameters, malformed data
2. Precondition Violations: System state requirements not met
3. Processing Errors: Failures during normal operation
4. Resource Errors: Insufficient memory, disk space, permissions
5. Timeout Errors: Operations exceeding reasonable time limits

Error Response Requirements:
- Specific error messages with context information
- Suggested remediation steps where applicable
- Error classification for automated error handling
- Preservation of system state for recovery operations
```

### Performance Behavior Specifications
Every unit must meet performance behavioral requirements:

```
Time Complexity Requirements:
- DatasetSplitter.execute_split(): O(n) where n is dataset size
- NormalizationManager.compute_parameters(): O(n*m) where n=samples, m=features
- PluginOrchestrator.execute_pipeline(): O(n*p) where n=data size, p=plugin count

Memory Usage Requirements:
- Dataset operations: Maximum 2x input data size
- Parameter storage: O(m) where m is feature count
- Plugin execution: Isolated to prevent memory leaks

Progress Reporting Requirements:
- Operations >5 seconds must provide progress updates
- Progress accuracy within 10% of actual completion
- Estimated time remaining updated every progress report
```

### State Behavior Specifications
Every unit must maintain clear state behavior:

```
State Transitions:
- All units start in 'uninitialized' state
- Successful initialization transitions to 'ready' state
- Processing operations transition through 'executing' state
- Completion transitions to 'completed' or 'error' state

State Invariants:
- State transitions are atomic and consistent
- Invalid state transitions are prevented and reported
- State information is always available for inspection
- State recovery is possible from non-terminal error states
```

This unit-level design provides comprehensive behavioral specifications for all system components, enabling thorough unit testing and implementation guidance while maintaining implementation independence. Each unit specification focuses on behavior contracts rather than implementation details, supporting robust behavior-driven development practices.
